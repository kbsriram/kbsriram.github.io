<h2 class="p-name entry-title">Book Review: Grouped</h2>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p ><a href="https://twitter.com/Padday">Paul Adams</a> is an insightful
guy. I was wowed by his early thoughts on online social networks from
back when he was <a
href="http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-network-v2">trying
to plug his ideas at Google</a>.</p>
<p >So I've been waiting to read (and just finished) <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Grouped-groups-friends-influence-social/dp/0321804112">his
recent book "Grouped"</a>, and a brain dump of that if you're curious.</p>
<p >It is a fast read, and feels a lot like an "Elements of Style" for
online social marketing. There isn't much discourse on theory, rather
a list of expanded bullet points on what goes on in online networks,
with a focus on marketing. The list of references at the end of each
topic is excellent, and worth pursuing.</p>
<p >Should you read it? Whether or not you choose to read <em>this</em> book,
here's his perspective:</p>
<p ><em>[To stay relevant] a new knowledge set is required [for]
designers, marketers, developers and advertisers: social behavior,
networks, and how people think.</em></p>
<p >The book distills his thoughts on these topics into self-contained
chapters, and coming from a guy who's probably had as many scars here
as anyone else, it'll be a useful reference for a practitioner to
spark ideas and avoid some mistakes.</p>
<p >However, the underlying ideas are things that he's been thinking and
talking about for a while, and you can get the general flavor from <a
href="http://vimeo.com/29576241">a video of one of his recent
talks</a> if you prefer.</p>
<p >Some of the homilies that stayed with me:</p>
<p >1. The social web is not merely a buzz. It will gradually become what
we think of as just "the web."</p>
<p >2. Think of the social web like electricity -- you don't have an
"electricity experience" in a product, it invisibly drives everything
and you just use it.</p>
<p >3. Center your products around people, not the technology or even the
content. Or somebody else will, and eat your lunch to boot. (The video
above has a example about Facebook photos and why it grew, interesting
perspective for any 'fish readers. Also interesting examples from
Etsy, nytimes and so on.)</p>
<p >4. The myth of the highly influential few. Highly connected does not
mean highly influential. He points out the situation in social groups
is more nuanced -- basically a rebuttal to the tipping point thesis as
applied to social marketing.ï»¿</p>
