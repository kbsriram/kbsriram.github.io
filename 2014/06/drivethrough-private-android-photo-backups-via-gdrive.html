Just documenting some code I use to privately backup photos from my
android phone to a laptop. The phone uploads photos as encrypted files
to GDrive. The laptop downloads and decrypts new photos, then deletes
files off GDrive. It's admittedly geeky to setup right now, but it's
worked out quite nicely as a private, no-hassle local backup of my
phone pics.</p>
<p >The <a href="https://github.com/kbsriram/drivethrough">code is sitting on
github</a> in case you feel inclined to mess about with it. If you
just want to try it out (and you'll want to be comfortable with
command line tools) skip the next few paragraphs of explanatory fluff
to get to the actual nuts and bolts. Otherwise, some babble
about how it works.</p>
<p >When you install the code on the laptop, it generates an OpenPGP
keypair, and stores the public key as <code>main.pkr</code> on your GDrive
account.</p>

<p >The next step is to install the android app on whatever devices you
wish to backup. Upon installation, each device also generates a keypair
and uploads the public half on GDrive. The app proceeds to download the
<code>main.pkr</code> file, encrypts photos against that key, and signs it
with its device key. Finally, encrypted files are uploaded to GDrive.</p>
<p >The app wakes up when there's a wifi connection, or there are new
photos. In either case -- if there are unsaved photos, it does the
same thing. That is, download the <code>main.pkr</code> file, encrypt,
sign and then upload new photos. If the fingerprint of
<code>main.pkr</code> changes, it stops and flags an error (so it works
roughly like SSH -- trust on first use.) Periodically downloading the
OpenPGP key allows me to change encryption subkeys frequently if I
feel the need to do this.</p>
<p >Back on the laptop side, I run a cronjob that downloads any new device
keys, and then any encrypted files. It decrypts the files, verifies
they are signed with the appropriate device key, and then deletes the
file on GDrive.</p>
<p ><strong>Using Drivethrough</strong></p>
<p >This is what I did on my Macbook. Since it's java code, in theory it
should work quite similarly on other platforms; but I haven't tested
it myself.</p>
<p >First create a directory where you'll host your archives - let's say
it's <code>$HOME/phone-archive</code>. Now download <a
href="https://github.com/kbsriram/drivethrough/raw/master/laptop/dist/drivethrough.jar"><code>drivethrough.jar</code></a>
to a convenient directory inside here, let's say
<code>$HOME/phone-archive/bin/drivethrough.jar</code>.</p>
<p >Next, you'll be setting up the app by connecting it to your GDrive
account. Run it from a command shell as:</p>
<pre >$ java -jar $HOME/phone-archive/bin/drivethrough.jar setup $HOME/phone-archive/data</pre>
<p >This command asks it to setup your GDrive, and download the archives
under <code>$HOME/phone-archive/data</code>. You will be asked to visit a
GDrive authorization URL in your browser. Follow the directions in the
browser, and you'll eventually get a code which you'll paste back in
the command shell.</p>
<pre >Enter code from browser: ...........</pre>
<p >Let it do its thing, and hopefully when it's finished that's pretty
much it as far as setting up goes. If you want to confirm that things
look good, you can visit <a href="https://drive.google.com">your
GDrive page</a> where you should find a new directory called
<code>drivethrough</code> with a file called <code>main.pkr</code> in it. This
is the public key generated from your laptop, and your connected
devices will encrypt against it.</p>

<p >I have a couple more things in that directory -- these are device
keys from my two connected devices. You too will find something like it
once you install the app on your phone.</p>
<p >The next step is to install <a
href="https://github.com/kbsriram/drivethrough/raw/master/android/bin/CStartActivity-debug.apk">the drivethrough apk
file</a> on your device. I'll leave you to figure out how to sideload
it on your device - it's currently tested only against
<code>android-19</code> or above.</p>

Just start it up, it should guide you through a couple of
authorization screens that permits it to access your GDrive. Once
you've authorized it, you can more or less forget about it. It'll just
wake up as needed, and upload your photos whenever wifi is available.
If you have a ton of photos on your phone (I had about 3Gb of photos
and videos) it can take hours before all your photos are
uploaded. It's almost entirely dependent on your wifi speed, so you
might want to wait on installing it until you can leave your phone
plugged in overnight next to some fast wifi connection.</p>
<div class="clear"></div><p >Back on my laptop - I just have a cron job that runs once a day that
looks like this.</p>
<pre >$ crontab -l | grep drivethrough
00 11 * * * /usr/bin/java -jar $HOME/phone-archive/bin/drivethrough.jar pull $HOME/phone-archive/data</pre>
<p >All this does is to pull down any new files, and copy them under the <code>$HOME/phone-archive/data</code> directory. Here's how it looks like at the moment.</p>
<p ><img src="/media/img/drivethrough-local.jpg"
alt="Drivethrough on laptop" class="full"/></p>
<p >You'll notice that the files are stored under the device fingerprint
key, and that the folder structure mirrors the actual structure of the
data on the device.</p>
<p >Once setup, this has been a pretty painless way to have photos taken
from my phone quietly arrive into my laptop. As a little bonus, it
does it without sacrificing the privacy of the photos; I don't really
want Google auto-indexing my photos. When I backup my laptop - these
photos also get backed up along with everything else; so that also
seems to work out well in case I lose or brick my phone.</p>
