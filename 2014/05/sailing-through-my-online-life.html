<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p >Save Anything Important Locally - a rule of thumb to regain control
over your data. Why this is useful, and documenting some things that I
do.</p>
<p >Recently, I've been quietly watching the evolution of the <a
href="http://indiewebcamp.com">indiewebcamp group</a>. It's an
eclectic collection of very smart people, and it's been fun to watch
their projects evolve and learn from them. While a lot of their goals
center around online identity, one of <a
href="https://indiewebcamp.com/principles">their principles</a> that
resonated with me is to <em>own your data</em>. It's something that I've
been doing rather haphazardly over the years, and I realized I have a different
take on it as well.</p>
<p >This post then is about what it means to me, and to document a couple
of things I do.</p>
<p ><strong>What</strong></p>
<p >We only have to look at our personal email to realize two things.</p>
<p >1. Most of us rely on an online service to store email for the long
term.</p>
<p >2. Email important to me is not necessarily <em>created</em> by me.</p>
<p >The second point highlights what it means to "own your own
data". Important content <em>also</em> arises when we communicate with
people - through email, sharing photos, comments etc. So rather than
thinking of it as just owning <em>my</em> data - I see it as taking
control of data that's <em>important to me</em>.</p>
<p ><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p >For most of us, data surrounding our interactions tends to stay within
the system that facilitates such interactions. Email tends to stay
within Gmail, photos shared with me on Facebook tends to stay within
Facebook, and so on.</p>
<p >You can probably imagine enough situations where this content is not
easily available. Perhaps it's as simple as just wanting to read your
email or look at photos when you don't have a network connection. Or
maybe the site itself decides <a
href="http://www.jonasblog.com/my-gmail-account-got-deleted">you can
no longer login</a>, or <a
href="https://indiewebcamp.com/site_deaths">is shuttered</a>.</p>
<p >Regardless of the reason, once you recognize the importance of such
content, you can begin to take control of it. A simple start is to
SAIL your data - keep an independent, local copy of data that's
important to you.</p>
<p >It's important to realize that the primary goal is not "a backup" - in
fact large sites are likely to do a better job at this. The goal is to
keep content independently under your control - in whatever manner
works best for you.</p>
<p ><strong>How</strong></p>
<p >I have a relatively quiet online presence - so most of what I find
interesting tends to be shared with me, rather than what I
originate. I'll focus on how I manage gmail and facebook, and also
stick with documenting what I do, since if you're reading this, you're
almost certainly technically savvy -- and you'll probably find a
different solution that works for you.</p>
<p ><em>Email</em></p>
<p >I use <a href="http://offlineimap.org">offlineimap</a> in a cron job
to periodically pull down emails from my gmail account to my
Macbook. After installing it through homebrew, I created a file
<tt>.offlineimaprc</tt> in my home directory that looks like this.</p>
<pre >[general]
accounts = GMail
maxsyncaccounts = 1

[Account GMail]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = /Users/kbs/gmail
sep = /

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = imap.gmail.com
remoteuser = myusername@gmail.com
remotepass = mypassword
ssl = yes
maxconnections = 1
realdelete = no
cert_fingerprint = 22b4c96075592f0e0e20134ae008ae4a5f0177a6
readonly = True
#if you only want the INBOX folder
#folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in ['INBOX']</pre>
<p >I run this in a cron job</p>
<pre >15 10 * * * /usr/local/bin/offlineimap -u quiet &#62; /dev/null 2&#62;&#38;1</pre>
<p >at 10:15am every day, which tends to be a good time when I'm ensconsed
in a place with internet connectivity.</p>
<p ><em>Facebook</em></p>
<p >My facebook setup is nothing more than a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kbsriram/05544b3f12a7b316c113">small bit
of java code</a> that uses the
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Facebook Graph
API</a> to download photos posted by or tagged with specific
people. It's not very sophisticated, but it works well enough for my
needs.</p>
<p >I have a directory <tt>archive/</tt> with create a file <tt>archive/fbtokens.txt</tt> that looks like
this.</p>
<pre >access_token=AAAAA....
download=John Doe,Jane Doe</pre>
<p ><tt>access_token</tt> is an OAuth access token - I use one I
pulled out from the facebook android app after logging in, because it
has all the privileges that I need.</p>
<p >The <tt>download</tt> property is just a comma separated list of
people whose photos I care about. As with the gmail backup, I run it
periodically in a cron job - and then I occasionally slideshow the
folders.</p>
<p ><strong>Preserving your data</strong></p>
<p >This can be a pretty tricky area, especially if you're hoping to still
see all this data in a couple of decades. I'm old enough to at least
understand some ways not to do it, so here's what I'm doing these
days.</p>
<p >On the data format end, I try to keep everything as uncomplicated as
possible - at the minimum, I want to be able to go through my data
without needing specific applications (like a particular database.)
Simple files and text tends to survive the longest. For example,
emails are just individual files, and the photos are just jpegs under
directories, with metadata in json files.</p>
<p >I use rsync to copy these folders into a couple of hard-drives, and
every few years when I feel guilty enough to remember, I re-copy old
folders into new hard-drives - or whatever new media might come
about. I wish I had a better way to automate this, but I haven't found
one that I can get onboard with.</p>
<p >The Japanese have a highly evolved tradition of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine#Rebuilding_the_Shrine">rebuilding
some Shinto shrines</a> every twenty years -- the Ise Grand Shrine is
now in its 62nd iteration. So <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation#Refreshing">this
technique</a> has some good precedents - let's see how it works out in
another decade or two.</p>
<p >I've started to keep a hard-drive at my friend's place as well, though
I find that that I haven't updated that copy in a couple of
years. Sigh.</p>
<p >Finally - should emphasize that I don't have any grand principles
against keeping data online. I very much continue to use gdrive and
dropbox to store an extra copy of some 'high-importance' stuff - but I
do this by encrypting a tarball of specific folders after my rsync
backup. This ensures I also have a local copy before pushing it
online.</p>
<p >Happy SAILing!</p>
