<h2 class="p-name entry-title">Inside the Android Play Service's Magic OAuth Flow</h2>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p >I was looking into how the Google Play library actually obtains <a
href="http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2012/09/google-play-services-and-oauth-identity.html">OAuth
tokens on behalf of apps</a>, as the actual nuts and bolts remain
undocumented.  Its implementation offers some interesting insights
into how Google handles issues that crop up up when using OAuth in an
Android app. The rest of this post presumes you know a bit about
Android, OAuth as well as how to <a
href="https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html">use
the Google Play Services library</a> to obtain access tokens. Sorry if
all this is down in the weeds, but that's where the fun bits are!</p>
<p >To get a disclaimer out of the way. These are just my observations
after poking at various dex files and network traffic and I've
undoubtedly missed many things; but I do hope to show you the broad
outline of how it works.</p>
<p >There are three points of interest.</p>
<p >1. Critical code runs only within a Google signed app (eg: the
<tt>com.google.android.gms/.auth.GetToken</tt> service.)</p>
<p >2. This service <strong>approves apps locally</strong>, and obtains
access tokens using a locally stored master token. It effectively
replaces the traditional web-based OAuth approval flow.</p>
<p >3. Third-party apps are identified by their signature and package
name, rather than an application-key/application-secret.</p>
<p ><img alt="separation of responsibilities" src="media/img/0768c6cd6c1f7fdeeaf1797210719da1e69d9177.png" class="centered"/></p>
<p >The green areas run "trusted" code. Your app uses the Google Play
Services client library; but the library itself doesn't run critical
code. It instead forwards calls to services and activities running
within a separately installed app ("Google Play Services".)</p>
<p >Here are some interesting bits of the manifest file for
<tt>com.google.android.gms</tt> (the "Google Play services" app) so
you get a feel for how it is set up.</p>
<pre >&#60;manifest
  android:sharedUserId="com.google.uid.shared"
  package="com.google.android.gms"
  ...&#62;
  &#60;service
    android:name=".auth.GetToken"
    android:exported="true"
    android:process="com.google.process.gapps"/&#62;

  &#60;activity
    android:name=".auth.login.LoginActivity"
    android:exported="true"
    android:process="com.google.android.gms.ui"
    .../&#62;</pre>
<p >As an app writer, you typically call <a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/GoogleAuthUtil.html#getToken(android.content.Context,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)">GoogleAuthUtil.getToken()</a>
from your application. The Play Services library first verifies that
the required Google apps (<tt>com.android.vending</tt> and
<tt>com.google.android.gms</tt>) are installed, and also that they have an
acceptable version and signature. The acceptable version numbers and
signature are embedded directly within the library. Your requested
OAuth scope is passed to the service, and now we're running inside the
trusted Play Services app.</p>
<p >Things start to get interesting within the get-token service.</p>
<p >This service first retrieves the app package name and signature of the
caller. This pair <tt>(caller_package_name,caller_signature)</tt> is
used to identify the caller. This mutual identification/verification
by the service and the calling library takes place right at the
outset; and presumably makes it more difficult for either the caller
or a rogue "Play Service" to spoof their identity to the other.</p>
<p >The service <strong>directly manages app approval</strong>, shows
dialogs to the user as needed, and creates access tokens for requested
scopes. In other words, it <strong>performs the app-approval</strong>
that would otherwise typically be done by the web-site.</p>
<p >This approach does have some advantages. By using a locally running
service in a trusted Google app, Google can take advantage of some of
the security features within Android.</p>
<p >For example, by using the package signature to identify your
application, it eliminates the need to embed application ids and
secrets in your apk (which can often be extracted out of a downloaded
application; allowing the bad guys to sign requests as if they came
from your app.) Package signatures are much harder to spoof - you'll
need the private signing key which is (hopefully!) never revealed; so
this is a better way to identify an app.</p>
<p >Further, all the access approval UI and token acquisition logic is
sandboxed inside the play app rather than being left to the
app-writer. Presumably, this reduces the "attack-surface", and also
allows bugs to be addressed quickly by updating this single app.</p>
<p >You might now be imagining the flip side of such a powerful Android
service, and you'd be right. This service has to be secure and
correctly alert the user during approval; for once provisioned, it is
capable of creating access tokens on behalf of any app, and with any
scope.</p>
<p >The get-token service does all this using what I call a <em>master
token</em> that it obtains from an undocumented authentication
endpoint at <tt>https://android.clients.google.com/auth</tt>. Here's
how it works.</p>
<p >When you first add an account to the device (say during device setup)
the service posts your password, which is additionally encrypted with,
I believe, a public key whose private counterpart is available to the
web endpoint.</p>

</pre><p >Note the Token field - this is the one master token to rule them all.</p>
<p >The master token is stored on the device using the <a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html">AccountManager</a>. You
should be aware that in most device configurations, AccountManager
stores this token in an unencrypted sqlite database
(<tt>accounts.db</tt> - usually somewhere under
<tt>/data/system</tt>.) Protection is primarily through the basic
linux file-system access controls - the directories are accessible
only to system processes.</p>
<p >My understanding of the Android Security Team's position is that
anything else is fundamentally security theatre. Encrypting the data
or the filesystem <a
href="http://source.android.com/devices/tech/encryption/android_crypto_implementation.html">is
a tricky subject</a> and solutions are <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29468">often
contentious</a>. At any rate; it means rooted devices (or devices that
can be rooted through an OS/driver weakness) are at risk of exposing
the master token - so be aware.</p>
<p >Next, a set of core google services request OAuth tokens for their
scopes. This also reveals how the get-token service generates access
tokens using the master token. Here for example, is how it creates a
token for one of the scopes requested by the market app.</p>

added if the service notices that the requestor signature is the same
as the google app signature; which is in fact the SHA value you see
above.</p>

</pre><p >Note the absence of the <tt>has_permission=1</tt> flag, and that the
<tt>client_sig</tt> is now the signature of the calling app.</p>
<p >The response is:</p>
<pre >issueAdvice=consent
Permission=View+basic+information+about+your+account
ScopeConsentDetails=%0AView+your+name%2C+public+profile+URL%2C+and+photo%0AView+your+gender%0AView+your+country%2C+la
nguage%2C+and+timezone%0A
ConsentDataBase64=...</pre>
<p >The user-interface is controlled by the <tt>issueAdvice</tt> flag in
the response. Automatically approved apps get the
<tt>issueAdvice=auto</tt> flag and an access
token. <tt>issueAdvice=consent</tt> causes the service to return an
Intent that if launched, shows a suitable consent dialog. (The Play
Services client library bundles this Intent into a <a
href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/UserRecoverableAuthException.html">UserRecoverableAuthException</a>.)</p>
<p >What happens when you approve a consent dialog? Nothing much - the
service merely adds the <tt>has_permission=1</tt> flag to a similar
request and gets back an access token. It really can create access
tokens for any and all scopes.</p>
<p >By the way - this also indicates how the <a
href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/01/verifying-back-end-calls-from-android.html">verified
app call mechanism</a> likely works. If you specify a
<tt>audience:server:client_id</tt> scope, the token service passes it
as usual with the <tt>(caller_package,caller_signature)</tt> pair to
the server. The server checks if this matches the information you
separately registered for that app, and returns a JSON Web Token
asserting this fact.</p>
<p >Naturally, all this assumes the basic Android system, as well as the
"trusted" Play Services app can securely identify the calling package;
and that nobody other than the trusted app has access to the master
token.</p>
<p >Given those assumptions, it's a nice technique. The Play Services App
contains an omnipotent "local-oauth-service"; playing the role of the
web-based approval flow but with an Android flavor. Third-party apps
are identified directly by their app signature, removing the need to
embed app secrets within the apk file.</p>
<p >Most users need (and should) enter their google password only when
setting up their device. Apps no longer use the inherently insecure
Webview approach to trigger the approval flow; nor do they need to use
the awkward and tedious flow via a browser Intent. The app never sees
anything other than the access token itself. Critical code runs only
in the Play Services app, so bugs can be fixed by just updating one
app.</p>
<p >Downsides?</p>
<p >Be aware there's a master token stored on your Android device which
has the latent ability to grant access to services you might not even
be accessing from it. If that token is ever exposed, you should assume
that all data associated with the account is up for grabs. Use the <a
href="https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager">Android Device
Manager</a> to reduce the window of opportunity if your device is
stolen, or manage this master token from <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">your
security settings</a>. Or, use a low-value account just for your
android devices; and keep critical documents in a separate account.</p>
