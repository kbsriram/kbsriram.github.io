How do you find the PGP key for someone who you only know via a
Twitter, G+ or Github profile? Add your profile url as a user id on
your key, and publish a fingerprint on your profile site.</p>
<p >For example, I've published mine on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+KBSriram/about">Google+</a>, on
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kbsriram/c05dca103a252ac0d6ac">Github</a>
and on <a href="https://twitter.com/kbsriram">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p >Clients can now find your keys in the distributed keyservers (eg: this
query finds <a
href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=github.com%2Fkbsriram">keys
that match my github profile</a>) and select ones that have a matching
fingerprint on profile sites linked from the key.</p>
<p >This provides a comparable degree of assurance a service like <a
href="https://keybase.io">keybase</a> offers -- namely, a person who
controls the key was able to publish to that profile site. But it
doesn't need the complication of an additional service, as clients can
directly check the profile sites after obtaining candidate keys.</p>
<p >I've <a href="https://github.com/kbsriram/keypan">implemented a sample
client</a> which does just this. It has a CLI as well as a
nicer-looking web interface from a locally runnable web server.</p>
<p ><img alt="keypan web" src="/media/img/keypan_web.jpg" class="centered"/></p>
<p >Given a profile URL, it searches and then automatically looks for
matching fingerprints in profiles linked from the key.  <a
href="https://github.com/kbsriram/keypan">The github page</a> has more
details as well as instructions for <a

your keys with <tt>gpg</tt></a> using this technique.</p>
