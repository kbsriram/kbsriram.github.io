Quick tip - loading Android nine-patch drawables

Did you need to load a stretchy nine-patch drawable from your assets
or the network, rather than directly via a resource? If so, you begin
to realize that the <tt>foo.9.png</tt> file in your source is actually
different from what's compiled into your apk, and you have to do
something similar before you can use the goodness of <a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/NinePatchDrawable.html">NinePatchDrawables</a>.

This <tt>aapt</tt> command converts a single <tt>input.9.png</tt> into
a version that can be loaded as a NinePatchDrawable

$code_begin
aapt singleCrunch -v -i  input.9.png -o compiled_input.9.png
$code_end

To load it within your code, simply use <a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.html">BitmapFactory</a>
to create a Bitmap from <tt>compiled_input.9.png</tt>, and then use

$code_begin
new NinePatch(mybitmap, mybitmap.getNinePatchChunk(), null)
$code_end

to create a <a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/NinePatch.html">NinePatch</a>,
and then use that within a suitable NinePatchDrawable constructor to
arrive at a nice, stretchable Drawable.ï»¿
