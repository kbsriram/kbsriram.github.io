Visualizing dependencies in the android framework

A small experiment to visualize dependencies between classes in the
android framework. This effort generated some some neat pictures, and
was a chance to play with svg.

$asis
<div class="clear"></div>

All the classes within the <tt>android.jar</tt> file in the
android-19 sdk are arranged in a circle and linked by a curved red
line to the classes that use them. The size of the code in each class
is indicated by a radial gray line.
<a href="/media/svg/android.html"><img src="/media/img/basic.jpg"
alt="basic screenshot" class="full"/></a>

Click on the image above to view the generated svg file. The file is
pretty large, but you can then hover over the lines to see the
associated class, or zoom your browser into specific portions of the
circle.

Classes are sorted by their fully qualified name, so classes within
the same package are adjacent to each other. You may notice clusters
of tiny arcs, which represent clasess used within their own package.
<tt>android.provider.BaseColumns</tt> is a typical example, it is
primarily used within its own package.

alt="android.provider.BaseColumns"/>

By contrast, some classes like <tt>android.os.Parcelable</tt> are used quite extensively everywhere in the framework.
<img src="/media/img/parcelable.jpg"
alt="android.os.Parcelable" class="full"/>

Some classes have a relatively enormous code
size. <tt>android.view.View</tt> is one such class - in fact the code
is large enough that it extends outside the limits of the drawing.

alt="android.view.View" class="full"/>

The code to generate the svg is pretty rudimentary, just good enough
to get the job done. I've put it up <a

playing with it as well.
