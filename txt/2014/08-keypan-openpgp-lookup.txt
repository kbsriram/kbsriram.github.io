What's the best way to let someone discover your PGP key if they only
know you via a Twitter, G+ or Github profile? Add your profile url as
a user id on your key, and publish a fingerprint on your profile site.

For example, I've published mine on
<a href="https://plus.google.com/+KBSriram/about">Google+</a>, on
<a href="https://gist.github.com/kbsriram/c05dca103a252ac0d6ac">Github</a>
and on <a href="https://twitter.com/kbsriram">Twitter</a>.

Clients can now search for keys in the distributed keyservers say, <a
href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=index&amp;search=github.com%2Fkbsriram">
by my github profile</a>, and only pick keys that also have a matching
fingerprint on profile sites linked from the key.

Is this a fully reliable proof of identity? Not really - for example
someone could have hacked into one of my social media accounts and
alterted it to a different fingerprint. But it provides a comparable
degree of assurance a service like <a
href="https://keybase.io">keybase</a> offers -- i.e. a person who
controls the key was able to publish to that profile site.

However, this simple technique doesn't need the complication of an
additional service like keybase, as clients can directly use existing
(and distributed) keyservers to find keys and check for confirming
fingerprints directly on profile sites added to the key.

I've <a href="https://github.com/kbsriram/keypan">implemented a sample
client</a> which does just this. It has a CLI as well as a
nicer-looking web interface from a locally runnable web server.

Given a profile URL, it searches and then automatically looks for
matching fingerprints in profiles linked from the key.  <a

details as well as instructions for <a

your keys with <tt>gpg</tt></a> using this technique.
