Getting pictures off my Nexus 4 into Snapfish has always been a chore,
and I'm a fan of single-minded automated apps. So I wrote this and
have been using it over the last few months. Set it up once and forget
about it pretty much. It's really nice to have the pictures just show
up in Snapfish without any effort.

I admit I may be a little biased :-) but if you use Snapfish I think
you'll like it.

1. Waits to upload (by default) over wifi at full resolution.

2. You'll have a copy of your photos in private Snapfish albums,
should you ever lose your phone.

3. If you order cards or photobooks from your computer, it's so much
easier having your phone pictures already on the site.

One more thing. Yep. <a href="https://github.com/kbsriram/savemypics">
Open-sourced for good measure</a>, love to hear your feedback or
contribute and extend it on github.
